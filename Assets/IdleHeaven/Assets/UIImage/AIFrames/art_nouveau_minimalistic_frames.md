# Art Nouveau Minimalistic Frames

Create a set of 9 slicable horizontal rectangular sprites in a minimalistic Art Nouveau style. Each frame should feature simple, flowing lines, subtle floral patterns, and elegant, curved shapes. The designs should be clean and understated, with a focus on minimalism while still retaining the characteristic motifs of Art Nouveau such as flowers, leaves, and geometric shapes. Ensure the frames have a cohesive look but distinct individual designs suitable for use in artwork or decoration.
